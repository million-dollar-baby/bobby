                myself
                after finishing a job. Life for me is like air, which becomes the breath and to keep up with my breath, I try to work out on not so regular basis, but make sure I find at least three to four days in a week. I love watching films, you
                can
                call me a complete movie buff. I love world cinema. (Talking about good cinema), loves to take up new challenges in life. I believe in making good friends, and yeah I do play cricket with my friends, watch a lot of theatre and find
                time
                to read some good books.”</p><br>
